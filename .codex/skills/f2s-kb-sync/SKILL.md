> Execution scope: this skill only maintains `.Knowledge`; by default it does not modify the configuration-root `rules/skills`.

## Orchestration (main / sub-agent)

- The meaning of `subAgent` / `switchAgentVerification` uses the unified entry as the only source of truth: **Cursor/Claude** read the configuration-root `rules/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.*`; **Codex** reads `.codex/topics/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.md` (same source, mirrored by `flow2spec init`).
- Step 1 (material collection): when `subAgent=true`, read-only collection may be split across sub-agents; they must not write files.
- Step 2 (outline + user confirmation): must be completed by the main agent; confirmation authority must not be delegated.
- Step 3 (write): when `subAgent=true`, writing may be split by confirmed outline item. Hard rule: before a sub-agent writes, it must load the opening summaries of 2-3 neighboring topics to align narrative style.
- Write-authority hard rule: `manifest-routing.json` and `.Knowledge/index.md` are always written at a single point by the main agent; delegation is forbidden.
- Verification: by default, the writing side verifies its own work; this SKILL does not bind cross-agent verification.

# f2s-kb-sync (Outline First, Then Write)

## Input (Optional)

1. The user explicitly provides an "implemented capability list".
2. Zero input: the Agent infers from current context.
3. Supporting materials: `@` files, requirement documents, architecture notes, etc.

## Mandatory Flow (Order Must Not Be Reversed)

### Step 1: Collect Materials (Read-Only)

- Summarize the user's target, scope, and priority.
- Summarize implemented capabilities (user-specified + Agent-inferred).
- Compare against the existing knowledge base:
  - `.Knowledge/topics/`
  - `.Knowledge/index.md`
  - `.Knowledge/manifest-routing.json`
  - `.Knowledge/matchers/*.json` (the shards corresponding to routing `matcherPath`)
  - `.Knowledge/stock-docs/`
- **Topic-granularity scan**: roughly scan existing topics for the following signals. If hit, list them as "recommended split" in the step 2 outline (does not block the sync flow):
  - The corresponding stock-doc exceeds **300-500 lines**.
  - `includeAny` has more than **12 terms**.
  - The topic body contains second-level headings covering more than **3 unrelated responsibility domains**.

### Step 2: Output the "Update Outline" (Required)

The outline must include at least:

1. Sync goal.
2. Capability list (user-specified / Agent-inferred / merged result).
3. Information sources.
4. Proposed file-change list (exact paths).
5. Topic sync plan: for each capability, state whether it updates an existing topic or creates a new topic, and list topicId, topic file, index row, and manifest/matcher changes. If `topicMetadata` is involved, list candidate `primary` / `tags` / `confidence` and evidence; if evidence is unclear, write "do not classify / do not write for now".
6. Out-of-scope items.
7. Prompt to wait for user confirmation.

> Before confirmation, writing any changes is forbidden.

### Step 3: Write After Confirmation

> Hard rule: if sub-agent splitting is enabled, a sub-agent must read the opening summaries of 2-3 neighboring topics before writing to align narrative style; `manifest-routing.json` and `.Knowledge/index.md` are written at a single point by the main agent, and sub-agents have no write authority for them.
>
> **Authoring-side guideline**: if this step adds or modifies topics, `topicMetadata`, or `topicDependencies`, first Read the full `rules/f2s-topic-authoring.*` (**Cursor/Claude**: `rules/f2s-topic-authoring.mdc`; **Codex**: `.codex/topics/f2s-topic-authoring.md`) before writing.

Update according to the outline, item by item:

- `.Knowledge/topics/*.md`
- `.Knowledge/index.md` (sync the "Associated documents (summary)" column in the topic routing table)
- Routing manifest (as needed). When creating a new topic, also sync `topicPaths` and necessary `taskToTopicRules` / matcher shards. Write `topicMetadata` only when evidence is clear; classification is only for governance, audit, and reading expectations, does not participate in route matching or execution requirements, and must not be used to create, rename, or split topics.
- `.Knowledge/stock-docs/*.md` (add source documents as needed)

### Step 4: Closing Summary

- List modified paths and purpose.
- List skipped items and reasons.

## Output Summary Format (Recommended)

```markdown
## Knowledge-Base Sync Result

### Confirmed Capability Scope
- <capability 1>
- <capability 2>

### Modified Files
- .Knowledge/topics/<topic>.md: <change description>
- .Knowledge/index.md: <change description>
- .Knowledge/manifest-routing.json: <change description or "unchanged">
- .Knowledge/matchers/<id>.json: <change description or "unchanged">
- .Knowledge/stock-docs/<doc>.md: <change description or "unchanged">

### Skipped Items
- <item>: <reason>
```

## Complex Scenario Example

The user only says "/f2s-kb-sync sync it" and provides no capability list.

- Step 1 first makes a minimal inference (for example, identify 1-2 capability domains from `git diff` / directory names), and provides the evidence.
- Step 2 must output an outline and wait for "confirm"; before confirmation, writing any `.Knowledge` file is forbidden.
- After confirmation, execute only items in the outline. If the user narrows the scope mid-flow, record skipped items in the closing summary.

## Constraints

- Outline first, write second.
- Add in small increments; avoid whole-file rewrites.
- Prefer in-place updates for the same topic.
- Each topic in `index.md` needs summary-level **clickable Markdown links** to `stock-docs/req-docs` (format: `[title](relative path)`, 1-3 links; "none" is allowed).
- Do not modify the configuration-root `rules/skills`.

## Completion Self-Check

1. No writes happened before confirmation (must be false).
2. Topic files and index rows correspond one-to-one, and the "Associated documents (summary)" column has been updated.
3. `topics` / `taskToTopicRules` / `topicDependencies` in manifest still reference valid paths.
4. If `topicMetadata` was written: every key exists in `topicPaths`; `primary` / `tags` / `confidence` are valid; type-prefix naming was avoided.
5. The configuration-root `rules/skills` was not modified (must be false).
6. The step 2 outline + user confirmation were not delegated to a sub-agent; before step 3 sub-agent writes, 2-3 neighboring topic summaries were loaded; manifest / index were written by the main agent only.
