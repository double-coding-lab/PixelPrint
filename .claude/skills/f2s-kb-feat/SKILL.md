description: Complete implementation and knowledge-base sync when adding a capability; if already implemented, only sync the knowledge base; triggers: f2s-kb-feat、新增能力、add capability、new feature
---

> Execution scope: `f2s-kb-feat` syncs `.Knowledge` by default; the user does not need to separately ask "please sync the knowledge base".

## Orchestration (main / sub-agent)

- The meaning of `subAgent` and `switchAgentVerification` uses the unified entry as the only source of truth: **Cursor/Claude** read the configuration-root `rules/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.*`; **Codex** reads `.codex/topics/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.md` (same source, mirrored by `flow2spec init`). Do not repeat those definitions here.
- **Code subpackage** (new / modified implementation code): when `subAgent=true`, it may be delegated to a sub-agent.
- **Documentation subpackage** (style-sensitive changes to rules / skills / topics / stock-docs): by default, do not split; the main agent writes them to preserve writing constraints such as "current truth wins", length limits, and no stacked historical negation.
- If documentation changes must be delegated: the sub-agent only outputs an "in-place replacement diff" (small before / after snippets) and must not rewrite whole files; the main agent merges and writes the result.
- **Write-authority hard rule**: `manifest-routing.json` / `.Knowledge/index.md` are always written by the main agent; sub-agents must not touch them.
- The writing side verifies its own work.

# Add Capability (f2s-kb-feat)

## Input

- The user describes the new capability, scenario, boundaries, and optional paths.

## Steps

**Step 0: Change Tracking (only when `changeTracking.feat: true`)**

Before execution, read `flow2spec.config.json`. If `changeTracking.feat: true`:

- Check whether `.task/todo.json` has an active task, and match the user description against `keywords`.
- Match -> load the corresponding `task.md`, show the remaining checklist, and continue in the existing task.
- No match -> create a new task (see the `f2s-task` rule), and write steps 1-4 into `task.md` as a task checklist.
- **Mandatory in-progress writes**: every time a step in `task.md` is completed, immediately `Edit` that step from `[ ]` to `[x]` in the same session; do not accumulate checkmarks until the "closing/archive" step, and do not use verbal completion instead of writing to disk (see `f2s-task` "interruption and session end" and "archive gate").
- **User todos**: whenever the user must change a repository, configure an environment, click a platform, or handle similar items, append them in the same session to `.task/active/<task-name>/user-todos.md` (see `f2s-task`); when creating a new task and there are no todos yet, still create this file (a placeholder is allowed).

1. Determine capability status: not implemented / partially implemented / already implemented.
2. Complete code implementation (skip this step if already implemented).
3. Sync the knowledge base (default behavior):
   - `.Knowledge/stock-docs/`: capability description and usage.
   - `.Knowledge/topics/`: add or revise topic rules and workflows.
   - `.Knowledge/index.md`: topic index.
   - Routing manifest: minimally update it when routing, dependencies, or `topicMetadata` change.
   - **Authoring-side guideline**: if this step adds or modifies topics, `topicMetadata`, or `topicDependencies`, first Read the full `rules/f2s-topic-authoring.*` (**Cursor/Claude**: `rules/f2s-topic-authoring.mdc`; **Codex**: `.codex/topics/f2s-topic-authoring.md`) before writing.
4. Output a summary (capability points, implementation, knowledge-base changes).

## Output Summary Format (Recommended)

```markdown
## New Capability: <capability name>

### Scope
- <capability point 1>
- <capability point 2>

### Implementation
- <file path>: <change description> (if no code changed, write "existing implementation")

### Knowledge Base
- .Knowledge/stock-docs/<file>.md: <new/revised description>
- .Knowledge/topics/<topic>.md: <new/revised description>
- .Knowledge/index.md: <update description>
- .Knowledge/manifest-routing.json: <whether updated and why>
- .Knowledge/matchers/<id>.json: <whether includeAny was updated and why>
```

## Complex Scenario Example

The user asks to "add a failure retry queue capability", and the code already contains a partial implementation.

- First classify it as "partially implemented" and fill the code gaps instead of rebuilding the whole module.
- Add or revise `topics/retry-queue.md`, and update the `index` entry description.
- If the capability needs to be matched by task routing (for example, "retry queue refactor"), supplement `manifest.taskToTopicRules`.

## Constraints

- When there is a conflict with an old convention: **rewrite to the current truth**; do not create additional historical-negation sentences such as "(no longer related to X)".
- Prefer in-place updates for overlapping existing topics.
- At least one knowledge-base update must be written, avoiding "code exists but cannot be retrieved".
- Do not modify the configuration-root `rules/skills`.
- Documentation subpackages are not split by default; when delegation is necessary, the sub-agent only outputs before/after diff snippets, and the main agent merges and writes them. `manifest-routing.json` / `.Knowledge/index.md` are always written by the main agent (write-authority hard rule).

## Knowledge-Base Writing Style (Required, Anti-Redundancy)

When writing `stock-docs` / `topics` / `index`, follow these rules:

1. **Minimal increment**: only append or rewrite text directly related to **this capability**; do not use "sync the knowledge base" as a reason to restate background, requirements, or tutorial-style setup unrelated to the implementation.
2. **Affirmative wording first (see the unified entry "knowledge-base writing style")**: state the correct description directly; do not communicate the new convention by negating the old one, except for mutually exclusive choices.
3. **Avoid duplicate narration**: do not write a long version of the same fact in both `stock-docs` and `topics`; make the executable convention clear in one place, and use a short paragraph + link in the other, or only list key points and reference paths.
4. **Prefer structured writing**: `topics` should focus on rules, boundaries, steps, errors, and configuration points; use lists/tables instead of long paragraphs when possible.
5. **Length limit (soft constraint)**: in one sync, new body text added to the **same file** should generally not exceed about **80 lines** (excluding code-block lines); if it exceeds that, split into a new topic or write "summary + see code path / another doc" first. Do not stack repeated explanation in one file.
6. **`index.md`**: only modify rows/table items related to this topic; do not refresh the whole table or section by copy-paste.
7. **Forbidden**: repeatedly explain Flow2Spec directory responsibilities, paste the full user conversation, or add long "historical review" sections unrelated to this diff.

## Completion Self-Check

1. Capability description matches the code implementation.
2. The new capability can be retrieved through a topic.
3. `index` and `manifest` were synced.
4. If `topicMetadata` was written: every key exists in `topicPaths`; `primary` / `tags` / `confidence` are valid; no topic was created, renamed, or split just for classification.
5. Knowledge-base changes cannot be compressed further without losing the rules and links after removing unrelated boilerplate.
6. No "negate old version / no longer related to something" redundant phrasing remains; if the current rule is clear, such sentences should be deleted or moved into a user-requested migration section.
7. No sub-agent rewrote documentation whole-file; manifest / index were written by the main agent only.
8. If `changeTracking.feat: true`: only archive `.task/active/<task-name>/` to `completed/` and remove the corresponding `todo.json` entry after all `task.md` "steps" are `[x]` (or canceled items are noted); do not move the directory while `[ ]` remains (same as the `f2s-task` archive gate).
9. If `changeTracking.feat: true`: `user-todos.md` exists; when user todos exist, its content matches the session conclusion.
