name: f2s-kb-distill
description: Extract reusable knowledge facts from Q&A and auto-commit to KB; decide whether to create new topic or append to existing topic based on drill-down depth; trigger: f2s-kb-distill, extract knowledge from Q&A, distill knowledge from conversation
---

> Execution scope: This skill only maintains `.Knowledge`, does not modify config root `rules/skills` by default.

## Orchestration (main / sub agent)

- `subAgent` / `switchAgentVerification` semantics follow unified entry as single source of truth: **Cursor/Claude** read config root `rules/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.*`; **Codex** read `.codex/topics/f2s-flow2spec-unified-entry.md` (same source, mirrored by `flow2spec init`).
- This skill does not split sub by default: Q&A knowledge extraction is a single-round focused task, completed by main agent is more efficient.
- Write permission constraint: `manifest-routing.json` and `.Knowledge/index.md` are always written by main agent only.
- Verification: self-verify on the side that writes to disk.

# f2s-kb-distill: Q&A-Driven Knowledge Extraction and Ingestion

## When to Use

- User asks → agent drills down source code to answer → need to solidify discovered knowledge into KB
- Usually auto-suggested by `f2s-kb-feedback-closing` rule, can also be manually invoked by user
- Distinction from `f2s-kb-sync`: `sync` is for batch syncing multiple capabilities; `distill` focuses on knowledge extraction from single Q&A

## Input

| Parameter | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User question | Auto-extract | Previous user question (auto-extract from conversation history) |
| Agent answer | Auto-extract | Previous agent answer content (auto-extract from conversation history) |
| Matched topic | Optional | If triggered by `f2s-kb-feedback-closing`, carries matched topicId |
| Drilled files | Auto-analyze | Extract referenced files/functions from answer (auto-analyze) |

Abort and prompt user when no valid Q&A context exists.

## Mandatory Flow (cannot be reordered)

### Step 0: Read Config and Rules

1. Read `flow2spec.config.json` (get `subAgent` / `switchAgentVerification`)
2. Read `rules/f2s-kb-feedback-closing.mdc` (get "reusable knowledge facts" definition)
3. Read `rules/f2s-topic-authoring.mdc` (get topic authoring guidelines)

### Step 1: Extract Q&A Context

Extract from previous conversation turn:

1. **User question**: Original question text
2. **Agent answer**: Complete answer content
3. **Matched topic**: Extract matched topicId if `f2s-kb-feedback-closing` already analyzed; otherwise re-route based on question
4. **Drilled files**: Extract all referenced file paths, function names, line numbers from answer
5. **Referenced code**: Extract code snippets quoted in answer

### Step 2: Analyze Drill-Down Depth and Knowledge Nature

#### 2.1 Calculate Drill-Down Depth Score

Accumulate following indicators (each 0-10 points, total 0-50):

- **Files read count**:
  - 0 files: 0 points
  - 1-2 files: 3 points
  - 3-5 files: 7 points
  - 6+ files: 10 points

- **Segmented read count** (same file read multiple times at different line ranges):
  - 0-1 times: 0 points
  - 2-4 times: 3 points
  - 5-8 times: 7 points
  - 9+ times: 10 points

- **Function/class reference count**:
  - 0-2: 0 points
  - 3-5: 3 points
  - 6-10: 7 points
  - 11+: 10 points

- **Code snippet length**:
  - 0-50 lines: 0 points
  - 51-150 lines: 3 points
  - 151-300 lines: 7 points
  - 301+ lines: 10 points

- **Answer length**:
  - 0-200 chars: 0 points
  - 201-500 chars: 3 points
  - 501-1000 chars: 7 points
  - 1001+ chars: 10 points

**Drill-down depth classification**:
- **Shallow** (0-15 points): Simple Q&A, minimal source code reference
- **Medium** (16-30 points): Medium complexity, multi-file consultation
- **Deep** (31-50 points): Deep exploration, extensive source code analysis

#### 2.2 Extract Reusable Knowledge Facts

Extract following types of knowledge from answer (refer to `f2s-kb-feedback-closing`):

- Core mechanisms (cache semantics, retry strategy, fallback logic)
- State transitions (state machine, lifecycle)
- Return value / error code contracts
- Configuration switch impacts
- Failure fallback strategies
- Module boundaries or calling conventions
- Data models and field semantics

**Extraction result**:
- Each knowledge fact includes: type, description, source (file:line)
- Sorted by importance

#### 2.3 Judge Extracted Knowledge Description Depth

Evaluate detail level of extracted knowledge facts (judged by content characteristics, not length):

- **Summary level**: Only conclusive description ("what it is", "what it does"), no conditions/flows/function details
  - Example: `Cache-first, fallback to OCR`
- **Detailed level**: Includes mechanism explanation, process steps, key judgment conditions ("when X", "if Y then", "first...then...")
  - Example: `Cache-first: use cached coordinates when hit; fallback condition: popup not dismissed, coordinates out of bounds`
- **Implementation level**: Includes function call relationships, state transition details, boundary condition handling, code examples
  - Example: `Cache read: call _get_cached_point_in_bounds("chat.input"), fallback when returns None; failure detection: VisualSearchPopup.find(timeout=0.08) is None`

#### 2.4 Evaluate Existing Topic Description Depth (only when "matched")

If matched an existing topic, need to evaluate its description depth (judged by content, not length):

1. **Read target topic content**
2. **Randomly sample 3-5 entries** (from different paragraphs)
3. **Judge each entry's description depth**:
   - **Summary level characteristics**: Only says "what it is", "what it does", enumeration style, no conditions/flows/function details
   - **Detailed level characteristics**: Contains "when X", "if Y then", "first...then...", judgment conditions, mechanism explanation
   - **Implementation level characteristics**: Contains function names `xxx()`, class names, file paths, parameters, code examples, state transition logic
4. **Majority level of entries = overall topic description depth**

**Judgment examples**:

| Topic Content | Judgment | Reason |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| `- Cache-first, fallback to OCR`<br>`- Send message action chain detection` | Summary | Only says "what", no details |
| `- Cache-first: use cached coordinates when hit`<br>`- Fallback: clear cache and re-OCR when popup not dismissed` | Detailed | Has condition explanation ("when...") |
| `- Cache read: _get_cached_point_in_bounds("chat.input")`<br>`- Failure detection: VisualSearchPopup.find(timeout=0.08) is None` | Implementation | Has function names, parameters |

**Important**: A 300+ line topic where every entry is "Module X: responsible for YYY" is still summary level; a 50 line topic where every entry has "conditional judgment + function call" is implementation level.

### Step 3: Decide Ingestion Strategy

Decide based on following decision matrix:

| Drill-Down Depth | Matched Topic | Existing Topic Depth | Extracted Knowledge Depth | Strategy |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------------------|----------|
| Shallow | Matched | Summary | Summary | **Append to existing topic** (add brief note) |
| Shallow | Matched | Summary/Detailed | Detailed | **Append to existing topic** (add detailed paragraph) |
| Shallow | Matched | Summary | Implementation | **Create sub-topic** (existing too brief, new too detailed) |
| Shallow | Not matched | - | Any | **Create new topic** (small topic) |
| Medium | Matched | Summary | Summary/Detailed | **Append to existing topic** (add detailed paragraph) |
| Medium | Matched | Summary | Implementation | **Create sub-topic** (gap ≥ 2 levels) |
| Medium | Matched | Detailed/Implementation | Detailed/Implementation | **Append to existing topic** (levels match) |
| Medium | Not matched | - | Any | **Create new topic** (medium topic) |
| Deep | Matched | Summary | Any | **Create sub-topic** (independent topic + stock-doc) |
| Deep | Matched | Detailed/Implementation | Detailed/Implementation | **Append to existing topic** or **Create sub-topic** (judge by semantic focus) |
| Deep | Not matched | - | Any | **Create independent module topic** (complete topic + stock-doc) |

**Decision keys**:
- **Description depth gap ≥ 2 levels** (summary vs implementation) → force create sub-topic, avoid style inconsistency
- **Description depth gap = 1 level** (summary vs detailed, or detailed vs implementation) → can append, but write detailed paragraphs
- **Description depth matches** (same level) → normal append
- **Drill-down depth ≥ deep** → prefer create sub-topic, unless existing topic already very detailed and semantics fully overlap

**Decision output**:
- Strategy type: `Append to existing topic` / `Create sub-topic` / `Create independent module topic`
- Target topicId: Existing topic id or suggested id for new topic
- Update content: Content to append or structure of new topic
- Description depth match: same level / 1 level gap / ≥ 2 level gap

### Step 4: Generate Knowledge Content

> **Authoring guidelines**: This step triggers creation/modification of topics and possible `topicDependencies`, must follow already-read `f2s-topic-authoring` guidelines.

#### 4.1 Append to Existing Topic

If strategy is "append to existing topic":

1. Read current content of target topic
2. Read style samples from 2-3 neighboring topics (for style alignment)
3. Generate content to append:
   - **Position**: Find most relevant paragraph, append after it
   - **Format**: Keep list/paragraph style consistent with existing topic
   - **Length**: Decide based on knowledge description depth:
     - Summary level: 1-3 lines
     - Detailed level: 5-10 lines, include mechanism explanation
     - Implementation level: 10-20 lines, include process steps and key functions

#### 4.2 Create Sub-Topic

If strategy is "create sub-topic":

1. Generate new topicId (based on parent topic + focus point)
2. Create new topic content:
   - Title and one-sentence intent
   - Applicable scenarios / trigger words
   - Core mechanism details (generated from extracted knowledge facts)
   - Dependency declaration (depends on parent topic)
   - Boundaries and prohibitions
3. Update parent topic:
   - Append link to sub-topic in relevant paragraph
   - Explain focus point of sub-topic
4. Update `topicDependencies`:
   - Add `sub-topic → parent topic` dependency edge

#### 4.3 Create Independent Module Topic

If strategy is "create independent module topic":

1. Generate new topicId (based on module name or problem domain)
2. Decide whether to create stock-doc:
   - Drill-down depth ≥ deep: create stock-doc (`<topicId>_final.md`)
   - Drill-down depth < deep: only create topic, no stock-doc
3. If creating stock-doc:
   - Structure: overview, core mechanisms, source files, key functions and flows
   - Content: generated from extracted knowledge facts and referenced code snippets
   - Length: 100-500 lines depending on drill-down depth
4. Create topic:
   - If has stock-doc, topic serves as summary + pointer
   - If no stock-doc, topic contains complete mechanism explanation

### Step 5: Sync Routing and Index

#### 5.1 Update manifest and matcher

- If creating new topic:
  - Add entry in `manifest-routing.json.topicPaths`
  - Create corresponding `matchers/<id>.json`, including:
    - Keywords extracted from user question
    - Terms extracted from answer
    - Suggested `includeAny`: 5-10 trigger words
  - Add routing rule in `taskToTopicRules`

- If updating existing topic:
  - Check if matcher needs new trigger words
  - Extract uncovered keywords from user question, append to `includeAny`

#### 5.2 Update index.md

- If creating new topic:
  - Add new entry in `.Knowledge/index.md`
  - Format: `- **[topic title](topics/<topicId>.md)** - one-line description | Related docs: [Final](stock-docs/<doc>.md)` (if any)
- If updating existing topic:
  - Check if description in index needs update
  - If added stock-doc, update "Related docs" column

#### 5.3 Handle topicMetadata (optional)

If has clear evidence, write to `topicMetadata`:

- Judge `primary` type from extracted knowledge facts:
  - Core mechanism/state transition/failure fallback → `policy`
  - Config switch impact → `config`
  - Module boundary/calling convention → `module`
  - Implemented capability/business logic → `feature`
- Set `confidence` to `inferred`
- Don't write when no clear evidence, list as "unclassified" in output summary

### Step 6: Write to Disk and Self-Check

Write in following order:

1. If has stock-doc: write to `.Knowledge/stock-docs/<doc>.md`
2. Write or update `.Knowledge/topics/<topicId>.md`
3. Update `.Knowledge/manifest-routing.json`
4. Update `.Knowledge/matchers/<id>.json`
5. Update `.Knowledge/index.md`

Self-check list:

1. Does topic content include extracted core knowledge facts
2. Does new topic have corresponding entry in index.md
3. Do topicPaths / taskToTopicRules in manifest reference valid paths
4. Does includeAny in matcher cover keywords from user question
5. If created sub-topic, is topicDependencies correctly set
6. Does appended content maintain style of existing topic (if read neighboring topics)

```

## Constraints

- Only maintain `.Knowledge`, do not modify config root `rules/skills`
- No user confirmation needed (Q&A already verified knowledge correctness)
- Keep lightweight, single Q&A knowledge extraction complete within 30 seconds
- Avoid over-splitting: unless drill-down depth ≥ deep and knowledge description depth ≥ detailed level, prioritize appending to existing topic
- Generated matcher includeAny should cover expressions users actually use, not just technical terms

## Self-Check After Completion

1. Correctly analyzed drill-down depth and knowledge description depth
2. Extracted all "reusable knowledge facts" (refer to `f2s-kb-feedback-closing` definition)
3. Ingestion strategy conforms to decision matrix
4. New or updated topic has entry in index.md
5. manifest / matcher correctly configured routing rules
6. Generated content maintains style of existing topic (if read neighboring topics)
