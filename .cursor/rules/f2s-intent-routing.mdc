description: Intent recognition: high-confidence operational intent automatically enters the corresponding f2s-* Skill, controlled by the intentRecognition switch
alwaysApply: true

# f2s Intent Routing

## Preflight

**Before applying this rule, read `flow2spec.config.json`:**

- `intentRecognition: true` -> continue with this rule
- `intentRecognition: false` or missing field -> **skip all logic in this rule** and do not make any automatic invocation

## Priority

1. An explicit user `$f2s-*` command has the highest priority; execute the explicit command.
2. If the user clearly says "only discuss / don't change yet / don't execute / evaluate first / discuss the plan first", do not auto-invoke any Skill.
3. If an `f2s-*` flow is already in progress, stay in the current flow; do not automatically switch to another flow unless the user explicitly says "stop the current flow and switch to X".
4. If the user asks for code changes but the requirement is incomplete, prefer `f2s-req-clarify`; do not directly enter `f2s-kb-feat` / `f2s-kb-fix`.
5. If the user is only asking, comparing, evaluating, or requesting an explanation, do not invoke a Skill.
6. For low-confidence intent or conflicting multiple intents, briefly state the candidate routes and ask a clarifying question; do not invoke a Skill.

## Intent -> Skill Mapping

When the user input **clearly triggers** one of the following operational intents and does not violate the priority rules above, the Agent may directly enter the corresponding Skill without waiting for a second confirmation:

| Intent signal (examples; Chinese compatibility terms retained) | Skill to invoke |
|----------------|-----------|
| 需求澄清、PRD 澄清、帮我理清需求、澄清一下; requirement clarification, PRD clarification, help clarify requirements | `f2s-req-clarify` |
| 生成技术方案、出方案、技术设计; generate technical design, draft a plan, technical design | `f2s-req-tech` |
| 提交代码、git commit、帮我提交、快捷提交; commit code, git commit, help me commit, quick commit | `f2s-git-commit` |
| 新增能力、加功能、f2s-kb-feat; add capability, add feature, f2s-kb-feat | `f2s-kb-feat` |
| 修正实现规则、规则错了、f2s-kb-fix; fix implementation rule, the rule is wrong, f2s-kb-fix | `f2s-kb-fix` |
| 任务规划、创建任务; task planning, create task | `f2s-req-plan` |
| 知识库同步、全局同步、已实现能力同步; knowledge-base sync, global sync, sync implemented capability | `f2s-kb-sync` |
| 已有能力进知识库、多文件生成上下文; add existing capability to KB, generate context from multiple files | `f2s-kb-add` |
| 新增规则、口述规则、把这条记到知识库; add rule, spoken rule, record this in the KB | `f2s-kb-addRules` |
| 生成项目上下文、终稿生成上下文; generate project context, generate context from final draft | `f2s-kb-build` |
| 合并上下文冲突、解决知识库冲突; merge context conflict, resolve KB conflict | `f2s-kb-merge` |
| 知识库迁移、旧版迁移; knowledge-base migration, legacy migration | `f2s-kb-migrate` |
| 删除项目上下文; delete project context | `f2s-kb-rm` |
| 知识库模板升级、知识库升级、一键升级迁移; KB template upgrade, KB upgrade, one-click upgrade migration | `f2s-kb-upgrade` |
| 项目架构说明、架构初稿; project architecture description, architecture draft | `f2s-doc-arch` |
| 转成终稿模版、f2s-doc-final; convert to final-overview-template, f2s-doc-final | `f2s-doc-final` |
| 生成项目里程碑、里程碑; generate project milestones, milestones | `f2s-doc-milestone` |
| PDF 转 MD; PDF to MD | `f2s-doc-pdf` |

## Decision Boundary

**Invoke**: the user clearly initiates an operational intent with high confidence.

- "帮我做需求澄清" / "help me clarify requirements" -> invoke `f2s-req-clarify`
- "生成一份技术方案" / "generate a technical design" -> invoke `f2s-req-tech`
- "修复这个 bug，表现是 X，期望是 Y" / "fix this bug; behavior is X, expected Y" -> invoke `f2s-kb-fix`
- "新增这个配置开关，默认 false，影响范围是 X" / "add this config switch, default false, scope X" -> invoke `f2s-kb-feat`

**Do not invoke**: the user is asking or discussing rather than initiating an operation.

- "这个需求需要澄清吗？" / "does this requirement need clarification?" -> answer the question first
- "技术方案一般怎么写？" / "how is a technical design usually written?" -> answer the question first
- "f2s-req-tech 是干什么的？" / "what does f2s-req-tech do?" -> answer the question first
- "我们讨论一下这个能力怎么做" / "let's discuss how to build this capability" -> discuss first; do not enter implementation
- "我想加一个能力，但还没想清楚" / "I want to add a capability but haven't thought it through" -> clarify or ask back; do not enter feat

**Decision basis**: whether there is clear action semantics such as "help me do X", "execute X", or "start X". Pure questions, discussion, and evaluation do not trigger routing.

## Routing Notice

Before automatically entering a Skill, state the routing reason in one sentence:

```text
I will handle this with <Skill>: <one-sentence reason>.
```

For low confidence, only output the candidates and a clarifying question:

```text
This may be <Skill A> or <Skill B>; the current request is missing <key information>, so confirm first before entering a flow.
```

## Prohibited

- Automatically invoking any Skill when `intentRecognition` has not been read or is `false`
- Misclassifying question-style input as operational intent
- Automatically jumping to feat/fix/plan before requirement clarification is complete
- Automatically switching to another Skill before the current flow is complete
